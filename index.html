    <h3>The best series according to Dewarshi</h3>

    <h3>Better Call Saul!!9</h3>
    <p>Better Call Saul, a prequel to the critically acclaimed Breaking Bad, has firmly established itself as one of the best TV series of all time.From the moment the first episode started, I was hooked and unable to tear my eyes away from the screen.</p>
    <h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
    <p>"Breaking Bad" is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends intense drama, brilliant storytelling, and exceptional character development.<br /> Vince Gilligan's creation is a gripping exploration of the transformation of Walter White from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a formidable drug lord. The writing is nothing short of brilliant, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats with each episode.</p>
    <h3>Narcos</h3>
    <p>This is an excellent drama that provides a mature distinct look towards recent history (that remains intensely relevant today as the results of this are still ongoing) while remaining entertaining and staying true to the general events, despite some moments being simplified for the purpose of story telling and drama.<br />This show is very engaging and respectful to its source material, even at points choosing narrate directly to the audience about real events (such as the death of agent Kiki camerania). This manages not to feel disconnected as the narration between episodes is used throughout and the discussed events quickly link back to the plot. </p>
